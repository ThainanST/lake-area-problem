# Python Lake Area Challenge

You will have an array (a list of lists) containing `0`s and `1`s. Each `0` represents land and each `1` represents water. A lake is made up of any number of vertically or horizontally adjacent (but not diagonally adjacent) `1`s. The number of adjacent `1`s determines the area of the lake.

Write a function that returns a list with the areas of the lakes contained in the matrix in ascending order.
